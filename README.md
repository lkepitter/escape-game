## Escape!

This simple game was created in a few days for the School of Code Christmas project. I set myself the task of trying to create a simple game in pure Javascript. First I followed a tutorial to build a Breakout clone (also in the repo), then took what I'd learned to try to make a simple adventure game. The player controls the blue square and must collect the key (yellow circle) to unlock the exit door (yellow rectangle) and escape. If they collide with an enemy (red square), they lose health.
